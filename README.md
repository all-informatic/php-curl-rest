# php-curl-rest
Universal HTTP/FTP Curl Client with REST interface (plugins and commands autoloader)

This project tries to uniformize curl calls using a REST style, with for now two plugins HTTP and FTP.
I have spend hard time to gather all the power of curl in one point， gathering all snippets code I found,
and adding a common wrapper to excute commands.。
