# php-curl-rest
Universal HTTP/FTP Curl Client with REST interface (plugins and commands autoloader)

This project tries to uniformize curl calls using a REST style. I has for now two plugins : HTTP and FTP.
I have spend hard time to gather all the power of curl in one point integrating all snippets code I found ( buggy or working, with
doc or not, etc...), and adding a common wrapper to execute commands. Simply enjoy an feel free to contribute.
